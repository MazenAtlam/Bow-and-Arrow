## Game Controls

The game uses the mouse only to do actions:

|**Control key**|**Action**|
|:----|:----|
|Mouse left click and drag|Control the vertical placement of the archer|
|Right click|Reload your arrow|
|Left click|Fire the arrow|

## Game Levels

You start each level with a quiver of 20 arrows.

1. **Level One:**
    - 15 red balloons aligned next to each other.
    - Pop each balloon to progress to the next level.

2. **Level Two:**
    - 15 random balloons, 3 tricky yellow balloons and 12 red balloons.
    - The yellow balloons have irregular speed and acceleration,
        providing an additional challenge.
    - Balloons are randomly placed, adding an element of surprise.

- You start each level with a quiver of 20 arrows.

## Balloon Dynamics

1. **Red Balloons:**
    - Constant speed and zero acceleration.

2. **Yellow Balloons:**
    - Irregular speed and acceleration for an extra challenge.

## Scoring System

- Score = (Remaining Arrows + 1) * Number of Shot Balloons.
- The score accumulates each turn, reflecting your skill and accuracy.
- Progress to the next level upon successfully hitting all the balloons
    in the current level.

## Game Strategy

- Plan your shots carefully to maximize your score.
- Watch out for the unpredictable yellow balloons in Level Two.
- Aim for efficiency and accuracy to conquer each level.
